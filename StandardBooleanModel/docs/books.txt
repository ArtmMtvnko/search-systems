in a quiet room i opened a book and the pages felt like doors
each chapter led me to new streets new oceans and new stars
i stacked more books beside me and the pile became a small city
when the night grew heavy i kept reading and the words kept a light on
by morning i closed the last cover and carried the stories with me
