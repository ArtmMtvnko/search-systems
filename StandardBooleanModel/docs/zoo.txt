at the zoo i have seen in the book i moved slowly from gate to gate
the lions rested and the keeper spoke in gentle tones
near the pond the penguins slipped through water like ink
children watched wide eyed and whispered quiet new names for every animal
when i left the zoo the city felt quieter and i missed the wild sounds
